What happens if you declare a variable and do not initialize its value, will the compiler accept it. or will the compiler throw any error ?

The compiler will not throw any error. Compiler will still execute the values by assigning the variables with default values.

for Integer it is : 0
for Double it is : 0.0
for String it is : null
for Boolean it is : false

what is the difference between local variable and instance variable?

Instance variables are declared inside the class but not inside the methods(functions), these variables are accessible from anywhere in the program depending on their access specifer.

Local variable are declared within a function adn can be accessed only within that function and cannot be accessed outside the function.
Local variables must be initialized before they are used within the program.
