Dangling Pointer

when the temp value returns the value to a function call, the pointer is now pointing to some Arbitrary memory location. This is dangerous.

Allocating on the heap
We can allocate space on the heap using a library function in malloc from stdlib.h

malloc(n) allocates 'n' bytes of memory on heap.

to create a 10 size memory on heap we create it in the following way.

ptr = (int *) malloc (10 * sizeof(int));
now the ptr will be allocated a memory of 40 bytes on the heap and the pointer to the starting address on the heap will be returned as a integer as we have type casted the starting address to (int *).

once we are done with our operations on the heap, it is advised to free memory on the heap.. it can be done with free(ptr).

forgetting to free the pointer created using malloc can lead to memory leak from the system.
this is because it makes way for Dangling pointer.
